# Julia Function Bug
This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when working with negative numbers in a simple Julia function.  The `myfunction` is intended to return the square of a positive number and 0 for negative numbers or zero. However, there is a discrepancy in the behavior with negative inputs. The provided solution addresses the problem by correcting the function's logic.

## Bug Report
The initial implementation of the `myfunction` produced incorrect results when a negative number was passed as an argument.

## Solution
The solution provides an updated implementation that correctly handles negative numbers, returning 0 as expected.
